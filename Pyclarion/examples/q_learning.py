### Setup ###
#############

# This simulation demonstrates q-learning in pyClarion. 

# The task is very simple: There are two prompts A and B and each prompt is 
# associated with a specific response (e.g., "Hello" and "Goodbye"). The agent 
# must learn to match the correct response to each prompt.

# Although it is not required, it is recommended to have matplotlib installed 
# to fully benefit from this demo.

# Here is the task definition (each iteration is one trial):

class ABTask(object):
    """A task where the subject must match the prompt to the response."""

        self.length = length

### Knowledge Setup ###

# To set up the Q-Net we need to provide it with some initial information:
#   - What features are in its input domain?
#   - What features constitute its output interface?
#   - What features signal reinforcements?

# To specify all this we use pyClarion feature domains and feature interfaces.

domain = Domain((
    feature("A"), 
    feature("B"),

        feature("respond", "A"),
        feature("respond", "B"),
        feature("respond", "standby")
    )
)

# To specify reinforcement signals, we use ReinforcementDomain, which expects a 
# mapping from features representing reinforcement signals to the dimensions 
# that they reinforce (recall, dimensions include the lag value). The mapping 
# must be one-to-one.

r_map = Reinforcements(
    mapping={
        feature(("r", "respond")): ("respond", 0),

        # SimpleQNet, will construct an MLP with two hidden layers containing 5 
        # nodes each. Weight updates occur at each step (i.e., training is 
        # online) through gradient descent with backpropagation. 

        # On each trial, the q-net outputs its Q values to drive action

### CONCLUSION ###
##################

# This example sought to demonstrate q-learning in pyClarion. 

# SimpleQNet makes use of pyClarion's native autodiff support, which should be 
# sufficient for learning and experimentation, but may be too slow for more 
# heavy applications.
