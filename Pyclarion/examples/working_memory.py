### Setup ###
#############

# This simulation demonstrates a basic recipe for creating and working with 
# working memory structures in pyClarion to guide action selection. 

# Here is the scenario:
# Alice has learned about fruits, as demonstrated in the chunk extraction 
# example. She is now presented some strange new fruits and attempts to 
# identify them.

### Knowledge Setup ###

# For this simulation, we continue using the fruit-related visual feature 
# domain from `chunk_extraction.py`. 

visual_domain = Domain(
    features=(
        feature("color", "red"),
        feature("color", "green"),

        feature("texture", "grainy"),
        feature("texture", "spotty")
    )
)

# We will have word features do double duty as perceptual representations and 
# action features. The idea here is that when a word feature is selected as an 
# action, the agent is assumed to have uttered that word (e.g., in response to 
# the question "What is the fruit that you see?").

    )

# available memory slots, defines commands for writing to and reading from each 
# individual slot, and defines commands for globally resetting the working 
# memory state.

# As in `chunk_extraction.py`, we construct a chunk database to store chunks.

# We then manually populate the database with chunks representing the fruits 
# that alice discovered in `chunk_extraction.py`.

### CONCLUSION ###
##################

# This simple simulation sought to demonstrate the following:
#   - A more complex simulation, where NACS drives action selection in ACS 
#     through working memory, and
#   - A recipe for setting up and using a working memory buffer.
