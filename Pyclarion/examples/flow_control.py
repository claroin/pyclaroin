### SETUP ###
#############

# This example will be addressing the basics of control in pyClarion. We will 
# extend the model presented in `free_association.py` to support control 
# of the mode of reasoning.

# In the proposed recipe, control of the mode of reasoning is achieved by 
# gating the output of various flows present in the original model. Gating is 
# implemented by wrapping the base process of the flow with multiplicative gate 
# which receives gating parameters from a parameter buffer. The parameter 
# buffer is modeled using a ParamSet process. It can be configured by a 
# controller to store and emit parameters to input filters, output gates, and 
# other parametrized processes.

### Knowledge Setup ###

# The semantic feature domain used in this simulation is identical to that used 
# in `free_association.py`, so we do not specify it again here. 

# To control emitter gating, we need to specify a feature interface. In 
# general, pyClarion processes subject to control specify constructors for their 
# control interfaces. These constructors offer a standardization of control 
# interfaces and automate the creation of control features. In general, feature 
# interfaces define two sets of features: commands and parameters. It is assumed
# that the controlled process expects to receive exactly one activated value for
# each command feature dimension at each time step. For parameters, it is 
# assumed that each parameter dimension contains exactly one value, and what is 
# desired is an activation strength for that value.

# Below, we specify the control interface for the ParamSet emitter that will 
# serve to control gating in our simulation. The tag argument defines the tag 
# for the command features. The values of the command features are set to their 
# defaults which are: "clear", "overwrite", "update", "standby". These can be 
# modified if desired.
# The clients argument specifies the constructs for which parameters will be 
# emitted. Basically, the ParamSet process will map activations of its 
# parameter features to the client constructs. The func argument specifies how 
# to map parameter dimensions to clients, taking in a client construct and 
# outputting the corresponding dimensional tag.

gate_interface = ParamSet.Interface(
    name="gate",
    pmkrs=("stimulus", "associations", "bottom-up")
)

# Feature interfaces also define default values for commands (one for each 
# command dimension). For this simulation, we would like the default values to 
# be selected unless some other command receives higher activation. To do this, 
# we will setup a constant buffer to activate default values to a constant 
# level.

# We set up default action activations using numdicts. Numdicts, or numerical 
# dictionaries, are a pyClarion native datatype. Fundamentally, they are fancy 
# wrappers around dictionaries that allow for mathematical operations. 
# Operations are carried out elementwise, where elements are matched by keys.
# Mathematical operations are supported between numdicts and constant numerical 
# values (ints and floats). Furthermore, numdicts may define default values to 
# handle missing keys. These defaults are appropriately updated under 
# mathematical operations.
 
# In this particular simulation, we set our default actions to have a constant 
# activation of 0.5.

default_strengths = nd.MutableNumDict(default=0)
default_strengths.extend(gate_interface.defaults, value=0.5)

# Next, we initialize and populate chunk and rule databases as in the original 
# example. 

cdb = Chunks()
rule_db = Rules()

rule_db.define(
    rule("1"), 
    cdb.define( 
        chunk("FRUIT"),
        feature("tasty", True),
        feature("sweet", True)
    ),
